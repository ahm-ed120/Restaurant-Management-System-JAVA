A clean, beginner-friendly restaurant management system designed to teach core Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Java without complex dependencies.

## Key Learning Objectives
- Core Java OOP principles (Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
- Basic console-based application structure
- CRUD operations implementation
- Simple business logic modeling

## Features (Pure Java - No External Dependencies)

### 🛠️ Admin Control
- **Menu Management**
  - Add/Delete/Update menu items
  - Search items by name/category
- **Employee Management**
  - Add/Update/Delete staff records
  - Search employee by ID/position

### 👨‍🍳 Customer Operations
- Place new orders
- Modify existing orders
- Earn loyalty points (1 point per $10 spent)

### 📊 Basic Order Processing
- Order calculation
- Simple receipt generation
- Loyalty points tracking

## Technical Simplicity
- ❌ No database (uses in-memory objects)
- ❌ No file persistence
- ❌ No GUI (console-only)
- ✅ Pure Java OOP implementation

## How to Run
1. Clone repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahm-ed120/Restaurant-Management-System-JAVA.git
   ```
2. Compile and execute:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   java Main
   ```

## Sample Workflow
```
1. Admin Login → 2. Manage Menu → 3. Add New Item
→ 4. Create Order → 5. Apply Customer Loyalty
→ 6. Generate Receipt
```

## Learning Highlights
- See OOP in action:
  - `Customer` inherits from `Person`
  - `Menu` and other classes demonstrates encapsulation
  - Polymorphic method calls in order processing

## Contribution Ideas for Beginners
- Add input validation
- Implement simple file persistence
- Create basic text-based UI improvements
- Extend loyalty program logic
